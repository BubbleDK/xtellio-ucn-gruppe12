# Dashboard for monitoring Key Performance Indicators on IOT Devices

## Overview

Welcome to "Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Dashboard" for [Xtellio](https://www.xtellio.com). A project developed on the 4th semester of AP in Computer Science at UCN Aalborg by Christian Funder, Emil Tolstrup Petersen and Jakob Kjeldsteen.
The grade for this project was a C (7 on danish grade scale)
This project is the development of a Proof of Concept for a KPI tracking Dashboard in collaboration with Xtellio. The project consists of a Vue typescript based frontend and a javascript based backend to fetch data from Xtellio's API endpoints

## Usage

This project has no actual use but lays the foundation for a proof of concept for an in-house KPI Dashboard. This project should help Xtellio and it's customers better understand the performance of their IOT Devices.
The Dashboard consists of Key Performance Indicators presented in a variety of tailored graphs to make it easy to scan for an overall performance of the given device pool.

An example of said dashboard:

It's also possible to interact with a graph on the site and be redirected to a detailed list view of the chosen graph information (for example clicking a bar on the battery distribution graph will apply a filter for that bar)
